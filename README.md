# Machine Learning Demo
A primer for Machine Learning with a demo developed in Python. Workshop by Keeley Edwards on March 11, 2022.

## Lecture Slides
Lecture slides for the training session are available [here](./BPT_Mar11.pdf).

## Run the Demo
Your OS must have Python3 and pip installed as a prerequisite. When met, run the following on a command line:
1. Install the following libraries needed to enable the program  
`pip install tensorflow`  
`pip install matplotlib`
2. Run the model  
`python3 model.py`

Now, you can watch a model being trained in real-time! After all epochs and parts are finished, it will print the confusion matrix in the end. Your confusion matrix will be slightly different from [Keeley's](./confusion%20matrices.png) and [Andrea's](./run%20result.png) generated results that reflects the nondeterminism of AI.
